# Paperwork installation on GNU/Linux Debian or GNU/Linux Ubuntu


## Package

Currently, there is no official Debian or Ubuntu package for Paperwork.

Note that Paperwork depends on [Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/).
Pillow may conflict with the package python-imaging (aka PIL).


## Build dependencies

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-setuptools python-dev

    # Pillow build dependencies
    $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev

    # Scipy dependencies
    $ sudo apt-get install libblas-dev libatlas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran

    # Sciki-lean dependency
    $ sudo apt-get install g++

    # Scikit-image dependency
    $ sudo apt-get install cython

    # PyEnchant dependency
    $ sudo apt-get install libenchant-dev


## Runtime dependencies

For some reason,
[setuptools doesn't work well with Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2434),
so you will have to install some dependencies yourself with python-pip:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
    $ sudo pip install numpy scikit-learn

You can then install paperwork using pip:

    $ sudo pip install paperwork

Some dependencies cannot be installed automatically, because they depend on your language. You can find all the required dependencies not yet installed by running 'paperwork-chkdeps'

    $ paperwork-chkdeps

## Install through packages generated by python-stdeb

If you're reluctant to install system wide python libraries through pip, you can also use debian packages generated on the fly by [python-stdeb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb) (install build dependencies above first):

    $ sudo apt-get install python-stdeb
    $ sudo pypi-install pyocr
    $ sudo pypi-install pyinsane
    $ sudo pypi-install scikit-image
    $ sudo pypi-install paperwork

## System-wide installation

    $ sudo pip install paperwork
    # This command will install Paperwork and tell you if some extra
    # dependencies are required.
    # IMPORTANT: the extra dependencies list may be drown in the output. You
    # may miss it.


## Running Paperwork

A shortcut should be available in the menus of your window manager (you may
have to log out first).

You can also start Paperwork by running the command 'paperwork'.

Enjoy :-)
